# Overview:-

To segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score to enable targeted marketing and personalized strategies.


# Technique:-

K-means Clustering Algorithm:
Initialization: Choose the number of clusters (k) and initialize cluster centroids randomly.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
Update: Recalculate the centroid of each cluster based on the assigned points.
Iteration: Repeat the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.


# Methodology:

Data Preparation: Clean and normalize the dataset
Cluster Selection: Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using methods like the Elbow Method 
K-means Clustering: Apply the k-means algorithm to segment customers into k clusters based on their annual income and spending score.
Analysis: Interpret the characteristics of each cluster to understand different customer segments.


# Result:-
Cluster Characteristics:

Cluster 1: Customers with high annual income and high spending scores.
Cluster 2: Customers with low annual income and low spending scores.
Cluster 3: Customers with moderate annual income and varying spending scores.


# Conclusion:-

Customer Segmentation: The k-means clustering technique effectively segmented customers into distinct groups based on income and spending behavior.
Actionable Insights: Businesses can target marketing strategies and tailor product recommendations based on cluster characteristics.
For instance, high-income, high-spending customers could be offered premium products, while low-income, low-spending customers could be targeted with budget-friendly options.
Model Effectiveness: The chosen number of clusters and the resulting segmentation should be validated with business objectives to ensure practical relevance.
